Cureviah: cross-border digital medical tourism platform that connects international patients to certified hospitals, clinics, and wellness centers in affordable destinations like South Korea, Thailand, India, Turkey, or Malaysia. But we will start from S.K.
Our mission is to provide a seamless end-to-end medical travel experience, from doctor selection and consultation to travel arrangements, local support, and post-treatment care. South Korea is known for its world-class medical services, especially in cosmetic surgery, dermatology, dental procedures, fertility treatments, and general surgery.
Problem Statement Healthcare systems in many countries are facing challenges such as:
High costs of treatment
Long waiting times
Limited access to specialists or advanced technologies
Language and cultural barriers when seeking care abroad
These issues discourage patients from receiving timely or necessary treatment. Meanwhile, South Korea has a surplus of high-quality medical services, but international patients struggle to access them due to lack of information, language issues, and logistical challenges.
Solution MedVoyage Korea will provide:
A centralized online platform with curated hospital and clinic listings
Transparent treatment pricing and procedure information
Online doctor consultations and pre-travel medical assessments
Travel and visa assistance
In-country support including interpreters and concierge services
Partnerships with hotels and recovery accommodations
Post-treatment care coordination and medical record transfer
